# py-bioinformatics

Repository created as an introduction to bioinformatics from reading FASTA, FASTQ files to accessing APIs. Code closely follows 
Bioinformatics with Python Cookbook - Third Edition by tiago antao. 

creating the environment following the book was not possible without encountering compatibility errors among dependencies.
In hopes that this is not an issue, enviroment.yml, and requirements.txt are provided. Any of these two files can be used to 
reproduce the conda environment.
